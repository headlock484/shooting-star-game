# 🚀 Easiest Way to Push Your Code - No Git Bash Needed!

Since Git Bash isn't showing up, here are **3 easy alternatives**:

---

## ✅ Option 1: Use GitHub Desktop (EASIEST - Recommended!)

**GitHub Desktop is a visual tool - no commands needed!**

### Step 1: Download GitHub Desktop
1. Go to: https://desktop.github.com
2. Click "Download for Windows"
3. Install it (takes 2 minutes)

### Step 2: Sign In
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (`headlock484`)

### Step 3: Add Your Project
1. Click **"File"** → **"Add Local Repository"**
2. Click **"Choose..."**
3. Navigate to: `C:\Users\fiona\OneDrive\Desktop\FINAL_shooting_star\public`
4. Click **"Add Repository"**

### Step 4: Publish to GitHub
1. Click **"Publish repository"** button (top right)
2. Name: `shooting-star-game`
3. Make sure **"Keep this code private"** is **UNCHECKED** (so it's public)
4. Click **"Publish Repository"**

**Done! Your code is now on GitHub!** 🎉

## ✅ Option 2: Upload Files via GitHub Website

**You can upload files directly through GitHub's website!**

### Step 1: Create Empty Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Name: `shooting-star-game`
3. Make it **Public**
4. **Check** "Add a README file" (this creates the repo)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. On your new repository page, click **"uploading an existing file"** link
2. Or click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
3. Drag and drop your entire `public` folder contents
   - Or click "choose your files" and select all files
4. Scroll down, add commit message: `Initial commit - Shooting Star Game`
5. Click **"Commit changes"**

**Note:** This works but is slower for many files. GitHub Desktop is better!

## ✅ Option 3: Find Git Bash Another Way

**Git Bash might be installed but hidden:**

### Try These:
1. **Search in Start Menu:**
   - Press `Windows Key`
   - Type: `bash` (not "git bash")
   - Look for "Git Bash" or "Bash"

2. **Check File Explorer:**
   - Open: `C:\Program Files\Git\`
   - Look for `git-bash.exe`
   - Right-click → "Pin to Start"

3. **Right-click in File Explorer:**
   - Navigate to your project folder
   - Right-click in empty space
   - Look for "Git Bash Here" option
